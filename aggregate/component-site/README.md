The purpose of this folder is to re-aggregate content from an upstream site such as JBoss Tools into a subset site, so that it can be published independently.

This is to allow unchanged projects to persist their content independently of a JBoss Tools release.

Examples:

* GWT: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/juno/core/gwt/1.1.0.Final/
* Freemarker: http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/stable/kepler/core/freemarker/1.3.100.Final/
* Birt: 
* Hibernate:
* Portlet:
